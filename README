This was a quick hack I threw together when I thought it would be interesting
to visualise results by polling booth in the 2010 Australian federal election.

The shade of a marker represents the magnitude of the 2PP result at that booth
- deep blue represents high Coalition 2PP and deep red represents high ALP
2PP, with lighter (gray) shades representing closer 2PP results. The size of a
marker represents the relative number of votes cast at that polling booth, so
as not to over-emphasise small booths.
